Ansible by default manages machines over the SSH protocol.

On the managed nodes, you need a way to communicate, normally ssh. By default this uses sftp, if not available you can switch to scp in ansible.cfg.
Also you need Python 2.4 or later, but if you are running less than Python 2.5 on the remotes, you will also need: python-simplejson

安装：
yum安装：yum install ansible
pip安装：pip install ansible
