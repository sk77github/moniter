My guess is that you have the python-crypto-2.0.1 RPM installed system-wide, and you didn't have gmp-devel installed when 
you built & installed a later version of PyCrypto, so you'reusing a newer version of PyCrypto with an older version of _fastmath.
You may try to do as suggested: install the gmp-devel package and then PyCrypto with pip.
